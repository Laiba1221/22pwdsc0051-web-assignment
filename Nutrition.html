            <h2>Meal Planning</h2>
            <p>Description</p>
            <p>Meal planning is the process of preparing and organizing your meals ahead of time to ensure balanced, nutritious eating throughout the week. It involves choosing recipes, creating shopping lists, and scheduling meals for each day. Planning meals can help you save time, cut down on grocery costs, and avoid unhealthy last-minute food choicesa
         a well-organized meal plan focuses on a variety of food groups, including lean proteins, whole grains, vegetables, and healthy fats. By creating a balanced plan, you can manage portion sizes and ensure youare getting essential nutrients daily. For those with busy schedules, meal planning can also include batch cooking or preparing ingredients in advance, making it easier to whip up a healthy meal during the week</p>
