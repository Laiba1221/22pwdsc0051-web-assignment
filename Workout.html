                    <h4>Reps</h4>
                    <p>A rep is a single completion of an exercise, like one push-up or one squat. The number of reps typically ranges from 8 to 15, depending on the goal (higher reps for endurance, lower reps for strength).</p>
                    <h4>Sets</h4>
                    <p>A set is a group of consecutive reps. For example, if you perform 12 squats, rest, and then do another 12 squats, you have done two sets of 12 reps. Sets provide structure to workouts by allowing rest between groups of reps, which helps with muscle recovery and performance.    </p>
                    <p>Together, sets and reps define the volume of a workout and help in achieving specific fitness goals, whether its building strength, endurance, or muscle size.</p>
